in  real time projects we will always use our username & password
we will never use scott/tiger.
it is the responsibility of database Administrator to create username & password.
connect system/tiger.
the default username in all  computers is system. and password is user choice.




                                   how to create user
          
          sysntax:   create user username identified by password;
                           1.create user bms identified by abc;
                           
              how to give permission to that username?
              
           2. grant connect,resource to username;
             grant connect,resource to bms;
